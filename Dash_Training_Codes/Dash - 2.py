#App layout takes list
#The 2nd component is a table representation of the Data
#The dash_table module gives this property
#It is DataTable provided by dash_table
#The first component is the title
#We import dcc module (Dash Core Componenents) we use dcc.graph to make graphs
#Also then we use plotly.express to give it as a figure input
#This is our 3rd component,title,table,graph

#We import dcc like we did in the previous section to use dcc.Graph. 
#In this example, we need dcc for dcc.Graph as well as the radio buttons component, 
#dcc.RadioItems.
#To work with the callback in a Dash app, we import the callback module 
#and the two arguments commonly used within the callback: Output and Input.

#Controls and Callbacks as our 3rd component we will add buttons and their
#usage

#1) The order you give the input determines the order it appears in the window,
#First we create radiobuttons after title as 2nd component then table then
#we tell we will give a graph using dcc.graph but figure is empty but it has an id
